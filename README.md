# Monopoly-as-Markov-Chains

In this project, the Monopoly board game is modeled as a Markov Chain. By applying the concept of steady-state probabilities, the most and the least probable squares on the board are found to find the most profitable property sets on the board to win the game.

Technical Summary ->
• Incorporated Dynamic Programming to find the most and least probable places on the board by calculating steady state probabilities 
• Devised strategy to buy the most profitable property sets to win the game using cost-benefit analysis
